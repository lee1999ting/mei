# Begin Again

Took a deep breath in the mirror

He didn't like it when I wore high heels

But I do

Turn the lock and put my headphones on

He always said he didn't get this song but I do

I do

Walked in expecting you'd be late

But you got here early

And you stand and wave

And I walk to you

You pull my chair out and help me in

And you don't know how nice that is

But I do

And you throw your head back laughing

Like a little kid

I think it's strange that you think I'm funny

'Cause he never did

I've been spending the last 8 months

Thinking all love ever does

Is break and burn and end

But on a Wednesday in a cafe

I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl

Who has as many James Taylor records as you

But I do

We tell stories and you don't know

Why I'm coming off a little shy

But I do

But you throw your head back laughing

Like a little kid

I think it's strange that you think

I'm funny 'cause he never did

I've been spending the last 8 months

Thinking all love ever does

Is break and burn and end

But on a Wednesday in a cafe

I watched it begin again

And we walk down the block to my car

And I almost brought him up

But you start to talk about the movies

That your family watches every single Christmas

I want to talk about that

For the first time what's past is past

'Cause you throw your head back laughing

Like a little kid

I think it's strange that you think

I'm funny 'cause he never did

I've been spending the last 8 months

Thinking all love ever does

Is break and burn and end

Then on a Wednesday in a cafe

I watched it begin again

Ooo

Then on a Wednesday in a cafe

I watched it begin again
