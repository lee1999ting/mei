# august

Salt air

And the rust on your door

I never needed anything more

Whispers

Of are you sure

Never have I ever before

But I can see us

Lost in the memory

August slipped away

Into a moment in time

Cause it was never mine

And I can see us

Twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away

Like a bottle of wine

Cause you were never mine

Your back

Beneath the sun

Wishing I could write my name on it

Will you call when you're back at school

I remember thinking I had you

But I can see us

Lost in the memory

August slipped away

Into a moment in time

Cause it was never mine

And I can see us

Twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away

Like a bottle of wine

Cause you were never mine

Back when we were still changing for the better

Wanting was enough

For me it was enough

To live for the hope of it all

Cancel plans just in case you'd call

And say meet me behind the mall

So much for summer love and saying us

Cause you weren't mine to lose

You weren't mine to lose

No

But I can see us

Lost in the memory

August slipped away

Into a moment in time

Cause it was never mine

And I can see us

Twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away

Like a bottle of wine

Cause you were never mine

Cause you were never mine

Never mine

Do you remember

Remember when I pulled up

And said get in the car

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call

Back when I was living for the hope of it all

For the hope of it all

Meet me behind the mall

Remember when I pulled up

And said get in the car

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call

Back when I was living for the hope of it all

For the hope of it all
