walked through the door with you, the air was cold</p><p>But something &#39;bout it felt like home somehow</p><p>And I left my scarf there at your sister&#39;s house</p><p>And you&#39;ve still got it in your drawer, even now</p><p>Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze</p><p>We&#39;re singing in the car, getting lost upstate</p><p>Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place</p><p>And I can picture it after all these days</p><p>And I know it&#39;s long gone and</p><p>That magic&#39;s not here no more</p><p>And I might be okay, but I&#39;m not fine at all</p><p>Oh, oh, oh</p><p>&#39;Cause there we are again on that little town street</p><p>You almost ran the red &#39;cause you were lookin&#39; over at me</p><p>Wind in my hair, I was there</p><p>I remember it all too well</p><p>Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red</p><p>You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed</p><p>And your mother&#39;s telling stories &#39;bout you on the tee-ball team</p><p>You taught me &#39;bout your past, thinking your future was me</p><p>And you were tossing me the car keys, &quot;fuck the patriarchy&quot;</p><p>Key chain on the ground, we were always skipping town</p><p>And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now</p><p>He&#39;s gonna say it&#39;s love, you never called it what it was</p><p>&#39;Til we were dead and gone and buried</p><p>Check the pulse and come back swearing it&#39;s the same</p><p>After three months in the grave</p><p>And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you</p><p>But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame</p><p>And I know it&#39;s long gone and</p><p>There was nothing else I could do</p><p>And I forget about you long enough</p><p>To forget why I needed to</p><p>&#39;Cause there we are again in the middle of the night</p><p>We&#39;re dancing &#39;round the kitchen in the refrigerator light</p><p>Down the stairs, I was there</p><p>I remember it all too well</p><p>And there we are again when nobody had to know</p><p>You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath</p><p>Sacred prayer and we&#39;d swear</p><p>To remember it all too well, yeah</p><p>Well, maybe we got lost in translation</p><p>Maybe I asked for too much</p><p>But maybe this thing was a masterpiece</p><p>&#39;Til you tore it all up</p><p>Running scared, I was there</p><p>I remember it all too well</p><p>And you call me up again just to break me like a promise</p><p>So casually cruel in the name of being honest</p><p>I&#39;m a crumpled up piece of paper lying here</p><p>&#39;Cause I remember it all, all, all</p><p>They say all&#39;s well that ends well, but I&#39;m in a new Hell</p><p>Every time you double-cross my mind</p><p>You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine</p><p>And that made me want to die</p><p>The idea you had of me, who was she?</p><p>A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you</p><p>Not weeping in a party bathroom</p><p>Some actress asking me what happened, you</p><p>That&#39;s what happened, you</p><p>You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes</p><p>Sipping coffee like you&#39;re on a late-night show</p><p>But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come</p><p>And he said, &quot;It&#39;s supposed to be fun turning twenty-one&quot;</p><p>Time won&#39;t fly, it&#39;s like I&#39;m paralyzed by it</p><p>I&#39;d like to be my old self again, but I&#39;m still trying to find it</p><p>After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own</p><p>Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone</p><p>But you keep my old scarf from that very first week</p><p>&#39;Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me</p><p>You can&#39;t get rid of it</p><p>&#39;Cause you remember it all too well, yeah</p><p>&#39;Cause there we are again when I loved you so</p><p>Back before you lost the one real thing you&#39;ve ever known</p><p>It was rare, I was there</p><p>I remember it all too well</p><p>Wind in my hair, you were there</p><p>You remember it all</p><p>Down the stairs, you were there</p><p>You remember it all</p><p>It was rare, I was there</p><p>I remember it all too well</p><p>And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ll get older, but your lovers stay my age&quot;</p><p>From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones</p><p>I&#39;m a soldier who&#39;s returning half her weight</p><p>And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?</p><p>Just between us, did the love affair maim you, too?</p><p>&#39;Cause in this city&#39;s barren cold</p><p>I still remember the first fall of snow</p><p>And how it glistened as it fell</p><p>I remember it all too well</p><p>Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?</p><p>Just between us, do you remember it all too well?</p><p>Just between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well</p><p>They say all&#39;s well that ends well, but I&#39;m in a new Hell</p><p>Every time you double-cross my mind</p><p>You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been
